/// A nursery represents a scope for a set of tasks to live in.
/// Execution cannot continue past the end of the nursery block until
/// all the tasks that were running in the nursery have completed.
///
/// Since C++ does not support asynchronous destructors, a nursery
/// requires special syntax to construct:
///
///    CORRAL_WITH_NURSERY(n) {
///        // `corral::Nursery& n` defined in this scope
///        n.start(...);
///        co_return corral::join; // or corral::cancel, see below
///    };
///
/// If any task exits with an unhandled exception, all other tasks in the
/// nursery will be cancelled, and the exception will be rethrown once the
/// tasks in the nursery have completed. If multiple tasks exit with
/// unhandled exceptions, only the first exception will propagate.
///
/// The body of the nursery block is the first task that runs in the
/// nursery. Be careful defining local variables within this block;
/// they will be destroyed when this initial task completes, but other
/// tasks may still be running. Anything that you intend to make
/// available to other tasks in the nursery should be declared _outside_
/// the nursery block so that its scope covers the entire nursery.
///
/// The initial task that forms the nursery block must end by returning
/// either `corral::join` or `corral::cancel`. `join` will wait for all
/// tasks in the nursery to exit normally; `cancel` will cancel the
/// remaining tasks. Note that in the latter case, after the cancellation
/// request is forwarded to the tasks, the nursery will still wait for them
/// to finish.
///
/// Tasks do not need to be spawned from directly within the nursery
/// block; you can pass the nursery reference to another function,
/// store a pointer, etc, and use the nursery's `start()` method to
/// start new tasks from any context that has access to the
/// reference. Once all tasks in the nursery have exited, execution
/// will proceed in the nursery's parent task, meaning the nursery
/// will be destroyed and any attempt to spawn new tasks will produce
/// undefined behavior. To avoid lifetime issues from unexpected
/// nursery closure, you should be careful not to preserve a
/// reference/pointer to the nursery outside the lifetime of some
/// specific task in the nursery.
