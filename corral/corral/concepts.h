// Corral extensions for async operation cancellation.
//
// To make an awaitable operation cancellable after it has been suspended,
// define await_cancel(). If its cancellation might complete asynchronously
// (as indicated by await_cancel() returning bool rather than std::true_type),
// define await_must_resume() to tell whether the parent's resumption
// represents cancellation or completion of the operation modelled by the
// awaitable.
//
// To change the default behavior where corral can propagate a cancellation
// instead of executing an awaitable at all, define await_early_cancel().
// If early cancellation can fail (as indicated by await_early_cancel()
// returning bool rather than std::true_type), define await_must_resume().
//
// An awaitable that does not define any of these methods will be
// synchronously early-cancellable and not at all regular-cancellable,
// as if it wrote:
//     auto await_early_cancel() noexcept { return std::true_type{}; }
//     bool await_cancel(Handle) noexcept { return false; }
//     bool await_must_resume() const noexcept { return true; }

// An awaitable that conforms to Cancellable<T> may be cancelled after
// it has started running.
template <class T>
concept Cancellable = requires(T t, Handle h) {
    // Requests cancellation of an in-progress operation represented
    // by this awaitable. May only be called after `await_suspend()`
    // has started executing and before the handle that was passed to
    // `await_suspend()` has been resumed. (This means that if
    // `await_suspend()` returns or resumes the handle it was passed,
    // or returns false to indicate that the parent task should
    // be resumed immediately, it is too late to call
    // `await_cancel()`.) Note that an `await_suspend()` implementation
    // that calls arbitrary user code must contend with the possibility
    // of that user code indirectly calling `await_cancel()`; for example,
    // the user code could call `cancel()` on a nursery that the awaiting
    // task is executing in.
    //
    // `await_cancel()` is passed a `std::coroutine_handle` for the
    // parent task, which will always match the handle that was originally
    // passed to `await_suspend()`. It has two choices:
    //
    // - If it can synchronously ensure that the operation will not
    //   complete, `await_cancel()` should ignore the passed-in handle and
    //   return true to indicate that the cancellation completed
    //   synchronously. Its caller is then responsible for resuming the
    //   parent task and propagating the cancellation.
    //
    // - Otherwise, `await_cancel()` must return false. This means the
    //   cancellation is in progress and its completion will be
    //   signaled by resuming the provided handle.  (It is permissible
    //   for such resumption to occur before `await_cancel()`
    //   returns.)  In this case, since coroutine resumption takes no
    //   arguments, there is a potential ambiguity between "the
    //   operation was finally cancelled" and "the operation completed
    //   normally before the requested cancellation could take
    //   effect".  See `await_must_resume()` for details on how this
    //   ambiguity is resolved.
    //
    // Mnemonic: a boolean return value from `await_cancel()` answers
    // the question "are we cancelled yet?".  Note that there's a
    // sense in which the return value meaning is opposite that of
    // `await_suspend()`: if `await_suspend()` returns false then its
    // argument handle will be resumed immediately, while for
    // `await_cancel()` this happens if you return true.
    //
    // Do not return true, or resume the provided handle, until you are
    // ready for the awaitable to be destroyed. Returning true counts
    // as a resumption, so doing both (returning true _and_ resuming
    // the handle) will produce undefined behavior.
    //
    // `await_cancel()` may return `std::true_type{}` to indicate that
    // cancellation can always complete synchronously. In addition to
    // the semantics of 'bool await_cancel(Handle) { return true; }',
    // this indicates that it is safe to propagate a pending
    // cancellation _before_ suspending the awaitable. Awaitables with
    // this property are called `Abortable`.

    // of the value returned by `await_ready()`.
    //
    // `await_early_cancel()` returns a bool, much like `await_cancel()`:
    //
    // - If it is fine to skip the operation represented by this awaitable
    //   in order to propagate the cancellation, return true. Neither
    //   `await_suspend()` nor `await_resume()` will be called in this case.
    //
    // - If it is important to start the operation, return false. In
    //   this case it is recommended that the awaitable remember that
    //   cancellation was requested, and attempt to prevent the
    //   underlying operation from taking unbounded time. (No further
    //   call to `await_cancel()` will be made, even if
    //   `await_early_cancel()` returns false.)  As with
    //   `await_cancel()`, when the parent task is resumed
    //   after `await_early_cancel()` returns false, the
    //   `await_must_resume()` method will be called to disambiguate
    //   between operation cancellation and operation completion.
    //
    // An implementation of this method is not required.
    // **If no `await_early_cancel()` method is provided, early cancel
    // is assumed to always succeed.** That is, the behavior is as if

    // ```
    // auto await_early_cancel() { return std::true_type{}; }

    // operation was cancelled (false) or that it completed despite
    // our cancellation request (true).
    //
    // Note that completing with an exception is considered a type
    // of completion for this purpose. `await_resume()` will be called
    // to propagate the result of this operation if and only if
    // `await_must_resume()` returns true.
    //
    // If a call `await_early_cancel()` returns false, and no call is
    // made to `await_suspend()` because `await_ready()` is already
    // true, then `await_must_resume()` will still be called to decide
    // whether to consume the value or not. This is something of a
    // degenerate case -- there's no reason for `await_early_cancel()`
    // to return false if `await_suspend()` is not required and the
    // awaitable's result is safe to discard -- but forbidding it
    // causes too many problems.
    //
    // If the operation technically did complete, but will not have
    // any observable effects until `await_resume()` is called, then
    // its awaitable may still choose to return false from
